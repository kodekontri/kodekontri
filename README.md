## Hi therðŸ‘‹, i'm Eseh Marvelous

I'm a web developer and coach with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Tailwind, Bootstrap, CodeIgniter, and Laravel. I'm passionate about building responsive and scalable web applications that solve real-world problems and make people's lives easier.

### What I Do

As a developer, I enjoy working on both front-end and back-end projects, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and learn new technologies.

As a coach, I enjoy sharing my knowledge and helping others grow as developers. I've worked with students and colleagues of all levels, from beginners to advanced, and I've developed a teaching style that's both clear and engaging. Some of the topics I cover include:

- HTML and CSS fundamentals
- JavaScript and jQuery, ReactJS, VueJS
- PHP, NODEJS and MySQL
- Frameworks like Laravel, Express and CodeIgniter
- Best practices for web development
